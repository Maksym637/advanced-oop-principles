### Design patterns:
__Design patterns__ are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

Patterns are devided into three main groups:
- __Creational patterns__ provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- __Structural patterns__ explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- __Behavioral patterns__ take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Creational Patterns
1. __Abstract Factory__ is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes:

2. __Builder__ is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code:

3. __Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created:

4. __Prototype__ is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes:

5. __Singleton__ is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance
