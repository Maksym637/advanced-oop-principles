### Design patterns:
__Design patterns__ are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

Patterns are devided into three main groups:
- __Creational patterns__ provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- __Structural patterns__ explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- __Behavioral patterns__ take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Creational Patterns
1. __Abstract Factory__ is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes:
